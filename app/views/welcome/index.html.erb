# Basic writing
## Paragraphs
Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

```
On July 2, an alien mothership entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen saucer-shaped "destroyer" spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide.

On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, participated in an assault on a destroyer near the city of Los Angeles.
```

## Headings
You can create a heading by adding one or more `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.

```
# The largest heading (an <h1> tag)
## The second largest heading (an <h2> tag)
â€¦
###### The 6th largest heading (an <h6> tag)
```

## Blockquotes
You can indicate blockquotes with a `>`.

```
In the words of Abraham Lincoln:

> Pardon my french
```

## Styling text
You can make text **bold** or *italic*.

```
*This text will be italic*
**This text will be bold**
```

Both **bold** and *italic* can use either a `*` or an `_` around the text for styling. This allows you to combine both bold and italic if needed.

```
**Everyone _must_ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.**
```

# Lists
## Unordered lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding list items with either a `*` or a `-`.

```
* Item
* Item
* Item

- Item
- Item
- Item
```

## Ordered lists
You can make an ordered list by preceding list items with a number.

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

# Links
You can create an inline link, by wrapping link text in brackets ( `[ ]` ), and then wrapping the link in parenthesis ( `( )` ).

For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: `[Visit GitHub!](www.github.com)`.


# GitHub Flavored Markdown
## Strikethrough
GFM adds syntax to create strikethrough text, which is missing from standard Markdown.

```
~~Mistaken text.~~
```

## Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```
For aesthetic purposes, you can also add extra pipes on the ends:

```
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```
Note that the dashes at the top don't need to match the length of the header text exactly:

```
| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Help      | Display the help window.|
| Close     | Closes a window     |
```
You can also include inline Markdown such as links, bold, italics, or strikethrough:

```
| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Help      | ~~Display the~~ help window.|
| Close     | _Closes_ a window     |
```
Finally, by including colons `:` within the header row, you can define text to be left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned:

```
| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |
```
A colon on the **left-most** side indicates a left-aligned column; a colon on the **right-most** side indicates a **right-aligned** column; a colon on both sides indicates a center-aligned column.
